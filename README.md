# Hack-Boilerplate

Generate boilerplate for new projects in [Hack](https://hacklang.org/). Just clone this repo and run `python3 run.py` with the following arguments:

* `-p`: Name of the project. Something like `my-hack-project`.
* `-a`: Author name (your name, presumably).
* `-e`: Author email.

You'll get a new repository in `../my-hack-project` (or whatever you named your project). `cd` in there and run `make build && make install` to get things going.
